### Loan Amortization Table Calculator

**Amortization tables** are essential when you need to assess a loan, understand the interest it will generate, future payment installments, and thus be able to evaluate the amount of debt you can manage or the interest you plan to obtain from a loan you are granting. Here we share a free and highly flexible **amortization table calculation** tool, with which you can generate various amortization methods, such as the French system (Fixed Installment), German system (Decreasing Installments), and American system (Fixed Interest).

Our **Loan Amortization Table Calculation** tool is essential for proper financial management. Simply enter the loan amount, interest rate, and term; you can also add more options like insurance, savings, or extra payments, and our **loan calculator** will generate a detailed table showing how the loan will be amortized over time. With this tool, you can visualize your monthly payments, the amount of capital and interest paid in each period, and more.
