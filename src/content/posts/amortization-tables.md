Choosing the right amortization system is crucial in personal and business finance. This article presents a comparative table that summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the French, German, and American amortization systems, for both lenders and borrowers.

## Amortization Systems

Amortization tables are essential to understand how a loan is amortized over time. Each amortization system - French, German, and American - has unique features that influence how capital and interest payments are distributed. Understanding these differences is vital for making informed financial decisions, for both those offering and receiving loans.

## Comparative Table of Advantages and Disadvantages

| Amortization System | Advantages for the Borrower                              | Disadvantages for the Borrower                  | Advantages for the Lender                                  | Disadvantages for the Lender                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **French**          | Fixed installments facilitate planning.                  | Higher interest payments at the start.         | Security in the flow of income from interests initially.   | Lower interest towards the end of the loan.       |
| **German**          | Decrease in financial burden over time.                  | Higher initial installments.                    | Quicker capital recovery.                                  | Interest income decreases over time.              |
| **American**        | Flexibility in postponing capital payment.               | Large capital disbursement at the end of term. | Security in the flow of income from interests.             | Risk associated with the lump sum capital payment at the end. |

### Detailed Analysis of Each System

- **French System**: Ideal for those who prefer predictability in their payments, although it entails a higher initial cost in terms of interest.

  The French system is the most common. In this system, the amortization installment is constant throughout the life of the loan. The installment is composed of a part of interest and a part of capital amortization. The interest portion is calculated on the outstanding loan balance, so the interest installment decreases as the capital is amortized.

- **German System**: Benefits those who can handle a larger outlay at the beginning, with the advantage of reducing the financial burden over time.

  The German amortization system, also known as the "constant amortization system" or "system of decreasing amortization installments," is based on the idea that the amount of the amortization installment is constant throughout the life of the loan, but the interest decreases over time.

- **American System**: Attracts those who need short-term flexibility, but involves significant risk for both the lender and borrower at the end of the loan term.

  The American system is not as well-known as the previous ones, mainly because it is not normally used by the common lender. It is based primarily on not making any principal payment until the end of the period, but instead paying a constant amount of interest on the principal in each installment.

## Conclusion

The choice of an amortization system should be based on a careful evaluation of the financial needs and capabilities of both the lender and borrower. The table provided offers a clear view of how each system can adapt to different financial situations, helping to make more informed and suitable decisions for each particular context.
