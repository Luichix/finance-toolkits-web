I appreciate you being here to learn a little about me. Over the years, I have developed a multidisciplinary profile that has allowed me to adapt to various stages in my life.

As a business administrator, I have consistently contributed to my family's businesses. This has involved planning and managing operations, as well as developing information management and control systems.

A few years ago, I was fascinated by the idea of creating scalable systems that could reach anyone, anywhere. For this reason, I committed myself to becoming a web developer. Today, I can finally share with you some tools and information, no matter where you are.
