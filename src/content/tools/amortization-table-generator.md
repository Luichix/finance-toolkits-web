#### Instructions for Use

Here are the filling instructions for the "Amortization Table Generator" form:

##### **Mandatory Fields:**

1. **Principal Loan Amount (Principal):** Enter the principal amount of the loan you are considering. This is the total amount of the loan you are requesting or evaluating.

2. **Interest Rate (Percentage Interest):** Enter the annual interest rate in percentage applied to your loan. This value determines the amount of interest you will pay annually on the loan. For example, if the rate is 5%, enter "5" in this field.

   - **Rate Type:** Select the type of rate applied to your loan. This consists of the time over which the rate is provided.

3. **Loan Duration (Loan Term):** Enter the period during which you plan to pay off the loan. This is usually expressed in years or months, depending on the lender's policy.

   - **Term Type:** Select the term type corresponding to the duration of your loan. It can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, depending on the frequency with which you wish to make payments.

4. **Payment Frequency (Installment Payment Frequency):** Indicate how often you will make installment payments. This generally matches the "Term Type." For example, if you selected a monthly term, the payment frequency should also be monthly.

5. **Amortization Method:**

   - Choose the amortization method to be used to calculate your payments and the distribution of capital and interest in each installment. You have three options:

     - **French System (Fixed Installment):** With this method, the installment remains constant throughout the loan, but the proportion of capital and interest changes with each payment.
     - **German System (Decreasing Installments):** With this method, the installment decreases over time, while the capital part increases and the interest part decreases in each payment.
     - **American System (Constant Interest):** In this method, you pay only the interest during the loan period, and the principal amount is paid at the end of the term.

     You can find more information about the most common types of amortization methods in the following [amortization tables](/amortization-tables).

##### **Optional Fields:**

- **Disbursement Commission:** If there is a disbursement commission associated with the loan, you can add it here. Indicate the amount of the commission, and if it's a percentage, select the "Use percentage rate %" checkbox and provide the corresponding percentage.

- **Grace Period:** If your loan includes a grace period during which no payments are made, enter the duration of this period in months.

##### **Recurring Payments:**

If you plan to make payments along with each loan installment, use this section.

- **Payment Type:** Select the type of recurring payment that will apply to your loan. You can add as many options as you need, just select or write the name of the payment you need such as Recurring Savings, Life Insurance, Property Insurance, and more. With this, you can click on add and only have to place the amount or the applicable percentage rate to the principal; if it's a percentage, select the "Use percentage rate %" checkbox.

##### **Additional Payments:**

If you plan to make additional payments at specific times during the loan, use this section.

- **Payment Period:** Indicate the period or month in which you wish to make an additional payment. Click on "Add" to add an extra payment and enter the corresponding amount; you can repeat this process as needed.

Once you have completed all the necessary and optional fields according to your financial situation, you can use the tool to generate the amortization table that will provide detailed information on how your loan will be settled, including monthly payments, accumulated interest, and outstanding balance. Be sure to review and verify the data before calculating the amortization table.
